# StacknHeap

Welcome to the official repository of **StacknHeap**, an organization of developers passionate about low-level programming, performance, and cybersecurity.

## 🌐 About Us

**StacknHeap** is a collective of developers driven by a constant pursuit of optimization, clean code, and mastery of both system-level languages and modern technologies.  
Our goal: to build tools, open-source projects, and solutions that are performant, secure, and scalable.

## 🧠 What We Do

- Development of system-level libraries and tools  
- Scripting and automation in Python / Go  
- Networking tools, packet analysis, and custom parsers  
- Ultra-fast backends using Golang / Rust  
- Open-source contributions  
- Security and performance experimentation  

## 🧰 Tech Stack

Here are the main languages we use actively:

- **C / C++** — for performance and full control  
- **Rust** — for memory safety and reliability  
- **Go (Golang)** — for efficient, clean backend services  
- **Python** — for quick tooling, scripting, and automation  
- **JavaScript / TypeScript** — for web interfaces, CLI tools, and APIs  

## 🚧 Ongoing Projects

We are currently working on several projects, including:

- A network toolkit in Go  
- A modular reverse proxy in Go  
- Porting a custom PyTorch AI library to Rust  
- A binary analysis tool for ELF/PE formats written in C++  

## 🤝 Join / Contribute

We’re currently a small, close-knit team — but serious collaboration is always welcome.  
Feel free to follow us, fork our projects, or submit pull requests if you like what we do.
